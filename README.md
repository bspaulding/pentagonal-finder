PentagonalFinder
================

Problem
-------

Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, Pn=n(3n-1)/2. The first ten pentagonal numbers are:
1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, â€¦

It can be seen that P4 + P7 = 22 + 70 = 92 = P8. However, their difference, 70 - 22 = 48, is not pentagonal.

Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, Pj and Pk, for which their sum and difference is pentagonal and D = |Pk - Pj| is minimised; what is the value of D?

Running the PentagonalFinder
----------------------------

To run without status info:
    rake find
To run with status info, which is significantly slower:
    rake find[true]

Running the tests
-----------------

To run the unit tests:
    rake
or:
    rake test

Requirements
------------
Running the tests requires ruby 1.9, the finder should run on ruby 1.8.7, but has not been tested.
